3. Where else I’d change the screen microcopy

Looking at the screenshot, here are the places I’d sync with the intro and make things clearer for true beginners:

a) Subtitle under “Phase 2: Boundary Mapping”

Current:

Map the agent's environment, tools, and data flows to understand system boundaries

Suggested (aligns with your intro’s language about inside vs. outside):

Map what’s inside your agent versus the tools and data around it.

or

Map your agent’s world: what it can see, remember, and do.

Either one reinforces the “world/boundary” mental model before they even see the instructions.

b) Left panel: “Available Elements”

Current:

Title: Available Elements

Subtext: Drag elements onto the canvas

I’d make the subtext tell them what these things are in plain language:

Available Elements
Things in your agent’s world (APIs, UIs, logs, databases). Drag an element onto the canvas to add it to your map.

That ties directly to your “world” wording and to the three guiding questions.

c) Center panel: “Boundary Map Canvas” helper text

Current:

Place elements and connect them to processes by clicking an element, then clicking a process

This is technically correct but a little abstract. For beginners, I’d echo the physical panels:

Boundary Map Canvas

Drag elements from Available Elements onto this canvas.

Click an element on the canvas, then choose which internal process uses it on the right.

That’s exactly what they see and mirrors your “inputs → processes → outputs” framing.

d) Right panel: “Connect to Process”

Current:

Title: Connect to Process

Subtext: Select an element on the canvas first

I’d make this explicitly about “inside the agent” so it ties back to your intro:

Connect to Process
These are the processes inside your agent.

Click an element on the canvas.

Then click one or more processes it should connect to.

You can keep the existing labels like Memory (Remember/Learn) etc.—they already match your conceptual description well.

e) Optional: add a tiny “Your map should answer…” hint

If you can spare one extra line somewhere (even as a small hint under the canvas), I’d surface your three questions there, because they are pedagogically gold:

Your map should answer:
What can reach the agent? What can it remember? How does it act on the world?

That links the manipulations directly to the conceptual goal.
