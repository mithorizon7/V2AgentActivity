You’re right—that’s backwards pedagogy. We should **teach → model → guided practice → independent practice**, not drop them straight into sorting. And the “already in the right bins” bug absolutely undercuts learning.

Here’s a tight fix that keeps your 4+2 direction and is fast to ship.

---

# What to change (in order)

## 0) Add a short **Primer (Teach)** before Phase 1

**Goal:** give novices the concepts *before* asking them to classify.

* **Screen: “How agents work (4+2)”**

  * 4-step run loop: *Read (Perception) → Decide (Reasoning) → Plan (Planning) → Do (Execution)*
  * Rails: *🧠 Memory (Learning)*, *🔧 Tools & UI (Interaction)* — available to any step.
* **Micro-demo (30–45s)**: a tiny animation of the loop with one sentence per step.
* **1–2 quick “spot-the-verb” checks** (e.g., “choose” → Planning, “send” → Execution).
* **Gate:** Continue only after the micro-lesson completes (or the two checks are correct).

**Acceptance:** Users cannot reach Phase 1 until Primer is completed.

---

## 1) Insert a **Worked Example (I do)** before they sort

**Goal:** show exactly how an expert reasons.

* Show **6 example cards** and narrate why each belongs in its process.
* Use highlight cues (e.g., “*transforms inputs* → Perception”, “*chooses* → Planning”).
* Include one **near-miss** (“Call Calendar API” feels like Planning but is actually **Interaction**).

**Acceptance:** Example shows 1 card per process + 1 near-miss with explicit “why.”

---

## 2) Phase 1 becomes **Guided Practice (We do)**, then **Independent (You do)**

**Guided sub-round (reduced load):**

* Only **2 bins visible** at a time (e.g., Perception vs Execution), 6–8 cards total.
* After 2 wrong drops on a card, show a **contrastive hint**.
* Require a **1-sentence rationale** (with 3 seed prompts to click, e.g., “This *carries out* steps”).

**Independent sub-round:**

* All **6 bins** visible, 14–20 cards including **distractors**.
* **Timer removed**; **accuracy ≥80%** required to pass.
* Tailored “why” feedback after **Solve**.

**Acceptance:** Users can’t reach the boundary map until they hit the threshold in independent round.

---

## 3) Fix the “starts in right places” issue (critical)

**Goal:** guarantee no pre-sorted state and prevent subtle auto-placement.

* **Initial state:** all cards in an **Unsorted tray** (or completely off the board); **shuffle** every load.
* **Never** derive UI position from `canonicalProcess`. Hold placement only in **UI state**, not computed props.
* **Kill any effect** that places cards by default (audit for `useEffect` that hydrates from canonical answers).
* **Persist** progress locally so a refresh doesn’t “snap” them to correct bins.

**Acceptance:** On reload, cards remain unsorted (or in last user state); no auto-placement ever occurs.

# UI & copy that make this intuitive

* **Headings everywhere:** “**4-step run loop + 2 supporting systems (4+2)**”
* **Bin labels (dual):** “Read the data *(Perception)*”, “Decide *(Reasoning)*”, “Plan *(Planning)*”, “Do *(Execution)*”, “🧠 Memory *(Learning)*”, “🔧 Tools & UI *(Interaction)*”
* **Seed prompts under the rationale box:**

  * “This *transforms* raw input…”
  * “This *chooses* between options…”
  * “This *carries out* steps…”
* **Near-miss hints:** “If it *changes the plan*, it’s Planning; if it *follows* a plan, it’s Execution.”

# Implementation tasks (dev-ready)

1. **Primer gate**

   * Add `primerComplete` flag in global state; gate Phase 1 route until true.
   * Build a 2-slide micro-lesson + 2 MCQs; store completion.

2. **Worked example**

   * `WorkedExample.tsx`: fixed set of 7 cards (6 + 1 near-miss) with the model’s explanations revealed step-by-step (Next/Back).

3. **Phase 1 refactor**

   * Split into `Phase1Guided` (2 bins at a time) and `Phase1Independent` (all 6).
   * Require rationale text (≥ 6 characters) on drop before **Solve** unlocks.
   * Add distractors and near-misses to `cards.json`.
   * Add “after 2 wrongs, show hint” logic.

4. **No pre-sort**

   * Initialize as `cards.map(c => ({...c, bin: null}))`.
   * Remove any `useEffect` that maps by `canonicalProcess`.
   * `localStorage` persistence: `phase1Progress_v1`.
   * Add QA guard: log a console warning if any card renders in its canonical bin *before* user acts.

5. **Feedback**

   * Implement `feedbackRules` keyed by (cardId, wrongProcess) for targeted “why.”
   * Show “common confusion” tooltips under wrong bins post-Solve.

6. **i18n & accessibility**

   * All new copy to locales; run reading-level pass (~6–8th grade).
   * Keyboard alternative for drag (“Move to [Bin]” buttons); focus ring & ARIA live announcements on Solve.

# Quick test plan

* **Gate test:** Cannot open Phase 1 until micro-lesson + 2 MCQs completed.
* **Worked example:** Near-miss explained correctly.
* **Guided round:** With 2 bins, wrong twice → hint appears; rationale required.
* **Independent round:** Cards start unsorted & shuffled; ≥80% accuracy required; “why” feedback ties to each wrong.
* **Persistence:** Refresh preserves user placements; no card snaps to canonical bin.
* **A11y:** Complete the round with keyboard only.

---

# Why this fixes the pedagogy

* **Teach first:** Primer + Worked Example build a correct schema before application.
* **Scaffolded difficulty:** 2-bin guided practice reduces cognitive load, then full 6-bin independent practice builds mastery.
* **Real thinking:** Rationale + tailored feedback enforce *explanation*, not just recognition.
* **No false signals:** Scrambled start and no auto-placement mean success reflects understanding, not UI defaults.

## What happens next

Once they clear Phase 1 with this path, they hit Boundary → Builder → Run/Trace → Failure Injection—now on a solid foundation.

**Confidence:**

* **High** this change removes the current pedagogical flaw and improves learning outcomes.
* **High** feasibility (all changes are UI/state + copy; no heavy backend).
* **Medium** on exact hint wording density—expect one tuning pass after a quick user test.
