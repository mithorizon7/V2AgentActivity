**Short answer:** You’re close on the *learning shell* (classification + boundary + tracer + failure toggles), but you’re still missing the *engine that makes it genuinely educational for beginners* (fixed 4‑slot pipeline + executable blocks + concrete Health Coach scenario). That gap is the difference between a polished demo and a tool that teaches causal understanding.

I tried to pull the “most recent version” via the available connector in this environment; no actions/resources were exposed. So this snapshot is based on the latest status you shared (and the behaviors implied by it). If you want me to review a live branch or build artifact, I can do that once it’s exposed.

## Current state at a glance (vs. the plan)

| Area                               | Status                   | Notes                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Classification w/ explanations** | **✓ Partial/Working**    | Drag‑drop + rationale present; add near‑miss distractors and targeted “why” feedback to deepen learning. |
| **Boundary mapper**                | **✓ Working**            | Enforce required node→process connections and provide specific “missing” messages.                       |
| **Failure injector (toggles)**     | **✓ UI in place**        | Real effect hinges on runtime; currently cosmetic without execution engine.                              |
| **Simulation tracer UI**           | **✓ Polished**           | Great scaffolding; needs to bind to *actual* pipeline logs.                                              |
| **Circuit builder**                | **✗ Mismatch**           | React Flow free‑form graph ≠ fixed, guided pipeline. Too open for novices; not executable.               |
| **Executable runtime**             | **✗ Missing**            | No `run(ctx)` blocks, no deterministic engine, no tool stubs.                                            |
| **Health Coach scenario pack**     | **✗ Missing**            | No fixtures or domain blocks; the “concrete” hook for novices isn’t there.                               |
| **i18n integration**               | **△ Present but unused** | Dictionaries exist, but components hardcode strings.                                                     |
| **Beginner defaults**              | **?**                    | Need prefilled runnable pipeline + one guided tweak.                                                     |
| **A11y & keyboard parity**         | **?**                    | Must verify: drag alternatives, focus order, color‑independent cues.                                     |

**Bottom line:** You’ve built the right *frames*; what’s left is wiring in the **fixed, executable core** and the **concrete scenario** so beginners see cause → effect when they change one block or flip a failure toggle.

## What “good” looks like for the newest build (novice‑ready DoD)

1. **Prefilled pipeline runs in one click** and shows a 4‑step trace with plain‑English subtitles.
2. **Swapping one block** (e.g., Reasoning: Threshold → Rule‑based) **changes the outcome** *and* the trace.
3. **Turning on “Noisy input”** visibly jitters the HR readings in the Perception step; smoothing mitigates it.
4. **Boundary check** confirms at least one critical link (Wearable → Perception).
5. **All learner‑facing strings** come from i18n files; dual labels appear (e.g., *Read the data (Perception)*).
6. **Full keyboard/screen‑reader parity** for classify, boundary, builder, and trace.

If your current build doesn’t satisfy all six, it’s not yet novice‑ready.

## Specific recommendations (ordered, small and finishable)

### 1) Land the core runtime (half‑day)

* Add a tiny, deterministic engine:

  * `runPipeline({Perception, Reasoning, Planning, Execution}, ctx)` → iterates slots, appends to `ctx.log`.
  * `applyFailures(ctx, toggles)` → mutates `ctx.input`/`ctx.tools`/`ctx.state` *before* the run.
* Implement **block registry** (3–4 per slot) for *Health Coach*:

  * Perception: `parseWearables`, `smoothWearables`
  * Reasoning: `thresholdCheck`, `ruleClassifier`
  * Planning: `dailyPlanner`, `safetyPlanner`
  * Execution: `sendNotification`, `updateStreak`
* Provide three fixtures (normal / borderline / edge).

### 2) Replace graph build with **fixed 4‑slot UI** (half‑day)

* Keep React Flow as a **non‑executing “Diagram Mode (beta)”** hidden by default.
* Slots show novice‑friendly labels with formal terms in parentheses:

  * *Read the data (Perception)* → *Decide what it means (Reasoning)* → *Make a plan (Planning)* → *Do the step (Execution)*
* Each slot’s modal: 1‑line *purpose*, 1‑line *effect*, 1 tiny example.

### 3) Bind the tracer to **real logs** (1–2 hrs)

* Trace rows show **badge + plain‑English subtitle**, details under chevron (JSON collapsed by default).
* Add top‑line metrics: `Result • Steps • Tool calls`.

### 4) Make failures **visible and reversible** (1–2 hrs)

* Before toggle: tooltip previews effect (e.g., “±20 bpm jitter”).
* After run: highlight changed inputs in the trace; “Reset to clean data” button.

### 5) Ship **beginner defaults & micro‑coach** (1–2 hrs)

* First‑run loads a **prefilled, runnable pipeline**; primary CTA is **Run demo**.
* After success: spotlight a single **guided tweak** (“Now change *Decide what it means* to Rule Classifier → Run again”).
* Right‑rail coach messages update per step.

### 6) Wire **i18n in core views** (2–3 hrs)

* Replace hardcoded strings in Builder/Boundary/Classification.
* Add dual labels to dictionaries (simple + formal).
* Lint rule to prevent new hardcoded strings.

### 7) A11y checklist pass (1–2 hrs)

* Keyboard alternatives for drag (Move to [slot]/[bin] buttons).
* Focus ring, logical tab order, skip‑to‑main.
* Color‑independent cues and reduced‑motion toggle.
* Screen reader announcements for step starts and results.

> These seven steps are small, additive, and each leaves the product better than it was the hour before.

## Red flags to fix before you demo to novices

* **Visual‑only tracer** (no causal change when blocks/toggles change)
  *Fix:* Connect tracer to `ctx.log` from runtime; delete mock steps.
* **React Flow as the default builder**
  *Fix:* Hide behind “Advanced (beta)”; ship fixed 4‑slot as default.
* **i18n files present but unused**
  *Fix:* Wire strings now; it’s mostly search‑and‑replace with `t()` calls.
* **No prefilled runnable state**
  *Fix:* Ship with sensible defaults and a one‑click run.

---

## Quick test plan (you can run these today)

**Unit**

* `smoothWearables` turns `[142,156,138]` → `hrAvg=145`.
* `thresholdCheck` sets `activeToday=true` when `steps>8000`.

**Integration**

* Default pipeline + Fixture 1 → `success=true`, plan=`congratulate`, tool calls=`1`.
* Swap Reasoning to `ruleClassifier` on Fixture 2 → plan changes to `nudge`.
* Toggle `noisyInput` → Perception input differs and `hrAvg` changes in trace.

**UI**

* First screen shows **Run demo**; Run produces trace; swapping Reasoning changes outcome.
* Classification **Solve** disabled until rationales present; wrong drops surface “why.”

---

## What you can safely defer (until after novices succeed)

* Instructor dashboards/analytics, state persistence beyond `localStorage`.
* Confidence calibration UI.
* Executing arbitrary graphs, parallel branches, loops.
* Additional scenarios (use the Health Coach win to template future packs).

---

## Overall read

* **Architecture:** Solid scaffolding; the choice to build a general graph first is understandable, but it’s the wrong default for novices.
* **Pedagogy:** Classification + boundary + *real* execution + visible failure is the right recipe—your tracer and failure toggles will shine once connected to a deterministic engine.
* **Feasibility:** High. The runtime and block registry are small; the UI adjustments are mostly copy and view logic.

---

## Confidence

* **High** on the gaps and recommendations (they follow directly from your latest status and the original plan).
* **Medium** on fine‑grained implementation details (I haven’t inspected the live code/build; connector exposed nothing here).
* **High** that landing the 4‑slot executable pipeline + Health Coach scenario will make this genuinely beginner‑ready and educational.
