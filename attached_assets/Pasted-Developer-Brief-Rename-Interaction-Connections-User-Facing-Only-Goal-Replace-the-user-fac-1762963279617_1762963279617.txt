Developer Brief — Rename “Interaction” → “Connections” (User-Facing Only)
Goal

Replace the user-facing term “Interaction” with “Connections” everywhere learners see it. Do not change back-end identifiers, enums, DB fields, or API names unless they are surfaced to the user.

Rationale (for context only)

“Connections” is clearer to non-technical learners: it means “talk to people or call outside services.” It also reduces confusion with Execution.

Canonical Copy (use verbatim)

Primary label: Connections

Long label (where space allows): Connections (People & Tools)

Tag/Chip (short form): Connections

One-line description: Talk to people or use outside services (email, calendar, web) at any point.

Litmus hint (tooltips/help): Is the agent reaching outside itself?

“Always available” badge text: Always available

Icon alt/ARIA label: Connections: people & tools

Keep capitalization: capitalize Connections when listed among the 4+2 components; otherwise sentence case.

Scope of Change (user-visible surfaces only)

Update only what learners can read/see:

UI Labels & Components

Section/cards/tabs/badges/chips titled “Interaction”

Category headers in the drag-and-drop activity

Diagram labels (SVG text), legends, step pills

Sidebars, nav items, breadcrumbs

Microcopy

Tooltips, hover help, empty states, hints

Success/error messages referencing the category

“Common mix-ups” or glossary snippets

Content & Exports

Printable worksheets/PDF exports

Slide images embedded in the product

Any in-app “copy deck” JSON used to render text

Accessibility & Metadata

ARIA labels, aria-describedby, and alt text

Visible analytics dashboards or user-facing reports that display the label

Docs & Marketing (if shown to learners)

In-app help, onboarding pages, glossary

Public course pages/screenshots used in the app

Out of scope (leave as-is): variable names, enums, DB columns, API routes, telemetry event names, CSS class names (unless user-visible), internal docs.

Minimal Copy Replacements (exact mappings)

“Interaction” → “Connections”

“Tools & UI (Interaction)” → “Connections (People & Tools)”

“Interaction (Tools)” → “Connections (People & Tools)”

“Interaction — Always available” → “Connections — Always available”

Any shortened label “Interact” in UI → “Connect” only if it is a button/verb; otherwise keep the noun “Connections.”

Copy Deck (drop-in text)

Use these strings wherever the UI needs the category definitions:

Connections
Always available
Description: Talk to people or use outside services (email, calendar, web) at any point.
Hint/Litmus: Is the agent reaching outside itself?
Alt text: Connections: people & tools

Iconography (if applicable)

Keep existing color and icon unless design requests a change. If you update:

Preferred icon: plug or speech-bubble-with-plug.

Update accessible name/alt: “Connections: people & tools.”

Search/Replace Guidance

Run a targeted search in UI/content layers only. Examples (adjust paths to repo):

Preferred: ripgrep with file filters

rg -n --glob '!**/node_modules/**' --glob '!**/dist/**' --glob '!**/build/**' \
   --glob '!**/*.test.*' --glob '!**/*.spec.*' \
   --glob '!**/*.ts' --glob '!**/*.tsx' --glob '!**/*.js' --glob '!**/*.jsx' \
   -e '\bInteraction(s)?\b' ./apps/ui ./packages/content ./public


Then replace strings in rendered copy files (React props, localization JSON, Markdown, SVG text).

Do not replace in: schema files, API specs, telemetry, migrations, or any interaction_* identifiers unless those are rendered to the user.

i18n/Localization

Update en source strings now.

If using i18n keys like labels.interaction, do not rename the key (avoid churn). Just update the value to “Connections”.

Add alias in search if your in-app search indexes content; map “Interaction” → “Connections” so legacy searches still find it.

QA Checklist (acceptance criteria)

No user-visible “Interaction” remains in the product UI, diagrams, tooltips, PDFs, or help.

The 4+2 diagram shows Connections (People & Tools) with the Always available badge.

Drag-and-drop category uses Connections consistently (cards, bin label, feedback).

Accessibility: screen reader reads “Connections: people & tools” where appropriate.

Legacy internal identifiers continue to function; no back-end or telemetry breaks.

Site/app search for “Interaction” returns results for Connections (synonym mapping).

Visual regressions: layout still fits where the label length changed.

Test Plan (quick)

Smoke test all pages with the 4+2 component, the classification activity, and any export flows.

Snapshot test key components if you have them (update snapshots that only change text).

Screen-reader pass (VoiceOver): confirm the accessible names.

Export one PDF and one PNG from the diagram to verify embedded text.
