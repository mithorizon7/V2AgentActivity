You'll learn that agents follow a 4-step process: they read incoming information (Perception), figure out what it means (Reasoning), decide what to do (Planning), and then do it (Execution). Along the way, they use two support systems: Memory to remember past experiences, and Tools to take actions in the world. You'll build your own simple agent, watch it run step-by-step, and learn to spot common problems when things go wrong. No coding required.",
