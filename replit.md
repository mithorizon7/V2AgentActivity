# AI Agents Learning Platform

## Overview
An interactive educational web application that teaches AI agent fundamentals through five pedagogically-designed phases. Learners progress from understanding core concepts to building and debugging their own agents.

## Project Structure

### Frontend Architecture
- **React SPA** with Wouter for routing
- **Internationalization**: i18next configured for easy future translation
- **Design System**: Custom educational theme with process-specific colors
- **Component Library**: Shadcn UI with custom educational components

### Core Learning Phases
1. **Classification & Explanation**: Drag-and-drop activity with required explanations and confidence slider
2. **Boundary Mapping**: Interactive canvas for mapping agent environment elements  
3. **Circuit Building**: Visual flow builder using React Flow
4. **Simulation & Testing**: Step-by-step execution tracer with failure injection
5. **Assessment & Review**: Comprehensive metrics dashboard with calibration scoring

### Six Agent Processes
Each with distinct color coding for visual learning:
- **Learning** (Purple): Memory, Adaptation, Feedback Loops
- **Interaction** (Blue): Communication, APIs, Output Generation
- **Perception** (Green): Input Processing, Context Understanding, State Tracking
- **Reasoning** (Orange): Logic, Knowledge Base, Heuristics
- **Planning** (Pink): Strategy, Optimization, Goal Setting
- **Execution** (Red-Orange): Tool Usage, Action Selection, Monitoring

### Key Features

- **Visualization**: React Flow (@xyflow/react)
- **i18n**: i18next, react-i18next
- **Backend**: Express.js with in-memory storage

### Design Philosophy
- **Pedagogical**: Based on cognitive apprenticeship, retrieval practice, and metacognition
- **Accessible**: WCAG compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

- **Visual**: Process-specific colors and clear visual hierarchy
- **Interactive**: Immediate feedback and step-by-step guidance

## Recent Changes (November 2024)
**Phase 1: Runtime Core & Executable Blocks**
- Built deterministic execution engine (runPipeline, applyFailures, createInitialContext)
- Created 8 Health Coach blocks with real run() functions processing wearable data
- Implemented 3 test fixtures (normal, borderline, noisy sensor data)
- Replaced free-form graph editor with fixed 4-slot pipeline (Perception → Reasoning → Planning → Execution)
- Made failure injection deterministic (±15 BPM alternating, -800 steps) for educational reproducibility

**Phase 2: Beginner-Friendly Enhancements**
- Added plain language dual labels: "Read the data (Perception)", "Decide what it means (Reasoning)", etc.
- Prefilled pipeline with sensible defaults so learners can run immediately
- Built GuidedCoachPanel component providing step-by-step guidance and tips
- Updated primary CTA to "Run Demo" for progressive disclosure
- Enhanced fixture descriptions and outcome summary chips (Result • Steps • Tool Calls)
- Improved Phase 3 and Phase 4 layouts with coach panel in side column

**Phase 3: Complete i18n Integration**
- Implemented translation-key architecture: blocks store keys (e.g., `healthCoach.blocks.perception.parse.name`), UI translates via t()
- Expanded translation.json to 260+ keys covering all beginner flow strings
- All components use useTranslation(): GuidedCoachPanel, FixedPipelineBuilder, LearningPage, SimulationTracer
- Health Coach blocks fully localizable: labels, descriptions, dual labels, failure modes
- Zero hardcoded English in critical learner path (Phases 3-4)
- Production-ready for multi-language deployment

**Phase 4: Shared Runtime Architecture (November 2024)**
- Moved runtime engine and types from client/ to shared/runtime/ for server accessibility
- Relocated Health Coach blocks and fixtures to shared/scenarios/health-coach/
- Updated all client imports to use @shared paths for consistency
- Refactored /api/simulate route to use real execution engine (createInitialContext, applyFailures, runPipeline)
- Fixed structuredClone error in applyFailures by excluding tools (functions) from cloning
- Cleaned up duplicate client-side files to prevent code drift
- Both client and server now use identical deterministic engine ensuring consistent execution results

**Phase 5: Enhanced Learning Features & Persistence (November 2024)**
- Expanded failure injection to include all three modes:
  - noisy-input: Adds ±15 BPM sensor noise (targets Perception)
  - missing-tool: Removes sendRecommendation tool (targets Execution)
  - stale-memory: Corrupts knowledge base (targets Reasoning)
- Implemented boundary mapping validation requiring:
  - Minimum 3 environment elements
  - Minimum 4 connections to processes
  - Coverage of all 4 core processes (perception, reasoning, planning, execution)
  - Localized validation feedback displayed in amber warning cards
- Enhanced GuidedCoachPanel with 6 adaptive states:
  - Welcome: First-time user with incomplete pipeline
  - First Run: Guidance for initial execution
  - First Success: Celebration and next steps
  - Failure Recovery: Debugging tips when errors occur
  - Failure Experimentation: Advanced guidance with failures enabled
  - General Experimentation: Multi-run exploration tips
- Integrated Phase 1-2 server persistence:
  - useSession hook creates/retrieves learning session with localStorage ID
  - useClassification hook persists classification submissions and confidence
  - useBoundaryMap hook persists boundary elements and connections
  - All mutations use React Query for optimistic updates and cache management
- Added 60+ translation keys for new features maintaining i18n completeness

**Phase 6: 4+2 Framework Integration (November 2024)**
- Implemented 4+2 conceptual framework distinguishing:
  - RUN_LOOP processes (perception, reasoning, planning, execution): Sequential 4-step execution path
  - SUPPORTING processes (learning/memory, interaction/tools): Cross-cutting systems available throughout
- Added block metadata (usesMemory, toolCalls) to all 8 Health Coach blocks enabling visual telemetry
- Enhanced FixedPipelineBuilder with horizontal rail visualization:
  - Memory rail (purple, Brain icon) displayed above pipeline
  - Tools rail (blue, Wrench icon) displayed below pipeline
  - Dashed connector lines ("tap indicators") show which blocks access each system
- Updated block picker dialog with informational badges:
  - "Uses Memory 🧠" badge for blocks that access memory
  - "Calls Tools 🔧: {toolName}" badges for blocks that invoke tools
- Enhanced SimulationTracer with rail tap badges on each execution step:
  - Purple Memory badge with Brain icon for steps accessing memory
  - Blue Tools badge with Wrench icon for steps calling tools
  - Real-time visualization of supporting system usage during execution
- Added Classification phase hints for supporting processes:
  - Amber hint boxes in Learning and Interaction bins
  - Explains "Supporting system: not in the 4-step loop" concept
  - Helps learners distinguish loop processes from cross-cutting concerns
- Strengthened Boundary Mapping validation with causal requirements:
  - Sensor → Perception: Sensors must provide input to perception layer
  - Execution → Tool/UI: Execution must connect to tools or UI to act
  - Reinforces 4+2 framework through structural validation
- Added 10+ i18n keys for framework explanation and hints
